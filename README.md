# React Chat App

This project was created during a React workshop. This is a chat room where you can log in and chat with your friends.
React, Typescript, Redux, Material UI, React Query, and outside API were used to create it. A few tests are also written
to demonstrate the ability to use them in the project.

This project was aimed at the practical application of the technologies mentioned earlier, without focusing much
attention on design.

If you want to check how it works you can open one chat in one browser and another chat in the incognito mode and chat
with yourself. Or you can send the link to your friend and chat with them.
